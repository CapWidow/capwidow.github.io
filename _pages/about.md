I am a Machine Learning Researcher with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from Sorbonne University, Paris. My expertise encompasses advanced neural networks, time series forecasting, spatio-temporal modeling, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). My research focuses on integrating theoretical innovation with practical applications, particularly in solving complex challenges in dynamic systems and data-scarce environments.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I worked at Total Energies for two years, focusing on photovoltaic simulation. During this time, I contributed to developing innovative solutions for renewable energy applications, gaining valuable experience in applying advanced modeling techniques to real-world challenges. My collaboration with Total Energies continued during my doctoral studies, where I developed machine learning models for oil production forecasting and surrogate models for reservoir simulations. These experiences have honed my ability to bridge cutting-edge research with industrial applications effectively.

My work integrates graph-based methodologies and physics-informed approaches to enhance the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of machine learning models. Alongside my research, I am committed to teaching and mentorship, fostering the development of innovative ideas and facilitating knowledge sharing.

Motivated by the transformative potential of machine learning, I aim to contribute to addressing high-impact challenges by combining theoretical advancements with practical implementation in both academic and industrial contexts.
